							<p>In the United States, many office workers develop carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on the median nerve in the wrist, the nerve that controls movement and feeling in the thumb and the first three fingers. CTS can present with pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness in the fingers or hand. The initial treatment is wrist splinting, which keeps the wrist in a neutral position to take pressure off the median nerve. The neutral position is similar to the position in which one holds a glass of water. If wrist splinting does not help, patients can receive carpal tunnel release surgery. Each year 25 women and 13 men out of every 10,000 adults in the United States undergo this surgery. Surgery carries certain risks such as surgery-related pain, possible hand weakness and complications, as well as the high costs of postoperative work absence. Therefore, a nonsurgical treatment would be advantageous, if it were just as effective as surgery.</p>
							<p>The main nonsurgical treatment for CTS is steroid injections, usually methylprednisolone. In this study, the researchers studied the effectiveness of local methylprednisolone injections in patients with CTS. Previous research showed that steroid injections were helpful up to one month after injection, but there was no research that looked into the effectiveness of these injections longer than one month. The researchers of this study also wanted to see if there was a difference in effect among an 80 mg dose, a 40 mg dose, and a placebo. The researchers looked at the effectiveness of steroid injections 10 weeks after surgery as well as one year after.</p>
							<p>Researchers found that patients who received 80 mg of the steroid injection had a greater improvement in CTS symptoms 10 weeks after injection than those who received the 40 mg dose. This improvement, however, was not shown to be statistically significant.</p>
							<p>At one year post-injection, there was no significant difference between those that received 40 mg and those that received 80 mg.At one year, 73% of people who received 80 mg of methylprednisolone had surgery, 81% of those who received 40 mg had surgery, and 92% of those who received the placebo had surgery. Also, at one year there was no difference in symptom severity between patients who received the steroid injection and those that received the placebo, indicating that the effectiveness of the steroid injection wore off before a year had passed. The researchers concluded that methylprednisolone injection reduces the rate of surgery compared with placebo, but as many as 3 out of 4 patients still went on to require surgery for symptom relief after the injection.</p>
							<h5>What this means for you?</h5>
							<p>If you have carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and wrist splinting is not adequately alleviating your symptoms, methylprednisolone injections may help alleviate many of the symptoms for at least 10 weeks and may also reduce the need for surgery. Be sure to talk to your doctor about the best option for you.</p>

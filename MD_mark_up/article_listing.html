Treatment plans that included a component of lifestyle change: dietary, exercise, and supplements, in addition to usual medical treatments were shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients.</p>

						<p>A recent study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) studied 1,076 children in pre-kindergarten, between the ages of three and five, and compared their cholesterol levels with their eating behaviors.</p>

					<div class='article_text'>
						<p>Dabigatran has been shown to be an appropriate alternative to warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Due to this fact, investigators sought to determine if dabigatran (brand name: Pradaxa) could be used as an effective alternative to warfarin in patients with mechanical heart valves. This was the premise of the RE-ALIGN trial.</p>

					<div class='arcitle_title'><h4><a href="#">New Diabetes Medicine Shows No Benefit for Cardiovascular Health</a></h4></div>
					<div class='article_text'>
						<p>Saxagliptin is a new diabetes drug that works by slowing the destruction of chemicals that help the body release more insulin. With more of these chemicals, there are increased levels of insulin, and so the body is better able to absorb glucose. A recent study evaluated this medication in terms of its effect on heart health (2).</p>

					<div class='article_text'>
						<p>This time a new study compares warfarin with edoxaban in their use for atrial fibrillation, which is a heart arrhythmia (abnormal rhythm) caused by disorganized electrical activity within the heart. Edoxaban works similarly to low molecular weight heparin or “lovenox” in that both inhibit the same protein involved in clot formation.</p>

					<div class='article_text'>
						<p>Medications are processed (or metabolized) by proteins in our bodies, inactivating the medications after a period of time. Some individuals process specific medications fast, while others process them at a slower rate. Our genes are one of the major factors that determine how fast we metabolize medications. Researchers have been able to identify the genes involved in Warfarin activity, which are known as CYP2CP and VKORC1.</p>

						<p>More aggressive treatment may come in the form of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), which is a mechanical circulatory device that is used to aid a failing heart in pumping blood.Used mostly in severe cases of heart failure, LVAD’s have proven to successfully manage those with serious heart failure and relieve many of its symptoms.</p>

						<p>The study looked at 251 patients who had mitral regurgitation and required surgery to fix the problem. The patients were randomly assigned to have either a repair or a replacement, and then their progress was tracked for 12 months. The researchers looked at the strength of the patient’s left ventricle, the mortality rates, the rates of heart attacks, and the return of mitral regurgitation to measure how well the patient’s had done.</p>

						<p>However, while many studies had been completed in the past comparing the most rigorous fiber eaters in the world with the least, little effort had been putting into quantifying just how much of dietary fiber will really prove helpful for the common citizen. A recent meta-analysis (review of lots of different papers on the same subject) from the UK set out to change that.</p>
